Credit Score Prediction: Problem Statement
Overview
Credit score prediction is a financial risk assessment problem where the goal is to classify or estimate an individual's creditworthiness based on their financial history and behavioral patterns. Financial institutions, such as banks and lending companies, use this prediction to decide whether to approve a loan, determine interest rates, or set credit limits.

Problem Definition
Given a dataset containing various features about a person's financial status, employment details, and past credit behavior, the objective is to predict their credit score category or estimate their credit score value.

Types of Credit Score Prediction
Classification Problem (Most Common)

The task is to classify individuals into predefined credit score categories, such as:
Poor (300-579)
Fair (580-669)
Good (670-739)
Very Good (740-799)
Excellent (800-850)
Regression Problem (Numerical Prediction)

Instead of categories, the goal is to predict an exact credit score on a scale (e.g., 300-850).
Input and Output
Input (Features)
A dataset with different financial, demographic, and behavioral variables, such as:
âœ… Demographic Information: Age, employment status, marital status
âœ… Financial Details: Income, total debt, credit utilization ratio
âœ… Credit History: Number of credit cards, past loan approvals, late payments
âœ… Loan Repayment Behavior: Number of missed payments, loan-to-income ratio
âœ… Other Financial Activities: Bank balance, investments

Output (Target Variable)
Classification: Predicts a category (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent).
Regression: Predicts a numeric value (e.g., 750 credit score).
